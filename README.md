### 2. Implemented but Not Working Properly
List any features that have been implemented but are not working correctly. Explain the issues you encountered, and if possible, the steps you took to address them.
> - Load/Save : It works correctly when the user save the game and then load it. 
However, when the load game button is clicked without saving, the error occurs with the message
``` this.gameVariables.blockClass" is null ```.
The problem is related to initializing the Data class in the LoadSave class when it is loaded from the savedData.obj.
I tried to re-initialize the Data Class before it takes the saved data. Also, the load game button is not active if there is no saved game.
But, it could not be fixed.
<br><br>
> - Ball Speed : The speed of the ball got faster when the game is reset or when it is played many times.
It is assumed that the problem is related to initialize, start and stop method in GameEngine Class.
It appears that during repeated game executions, instances of the game engine might occasionally be initiated redundantly instead of being consistently initialized.
I tried to initialize the gameEngine before every games so that the gameEngine would not be running at the same time. But I still could not fix it. 


### 3. Features Not Implemented
Identify any features that you were unable to implement and provide a clear explanation for why they were left out.
> - Multiplayer Mode : Building a multiplayer mode fot the brick game requires one more break. Then the second user can move the second break by pressing 'wasd' keycodes.
It was planned to add 'wasd' keycodes to move the second break. However, there were new errors when the ball hits the both break at the same time.
However, I was unable to implement because it was not user-friendly controllers and also the efficiency of the game got lower.
<br><br>
> - Block formation and customization: Making a difference initialized block formation requires expandable Memory or Customization to store. 
That is, the features needs additional memory or customization such as different styles of map or the ball.  Although this could develop the user experience of the game, it was left out.


### 4. New Java Classes

### 5. Modified Java Classes
List the Java classes you modified from the provided code base. Describe the changes you made and explain why these modifications were necessary.
> - Game Engine
>   - Deleted Initialize method because it could be made with initializing game variables in the game logic side.
>   - Deleted PhysicsCalculation method since the whole game could be easily controlled by onUpdate method and for the efficiency matter. 
>   - Created stop/go method for time variable as for the pause function for the middle of the game
<br><br>
> - Ball
>   - After creating Ball Class, the codes related to ball in Main Class were moved into the Ball Class
>   - The codes include the properties of the ball, isGoldStatus, initBall method, all the resetCollideFlags and setPhysicsToBall method
>   - Created BallEntry list so that it can store multiple balls.
>   - Maintained goldTime / isGoldStatus static variable to check the ball's status
>   - Created ballSound and its path to add sound when the ball hits an object using MediaPlayer library
>   - Created checkGoldTimeOver and setGoldTime method and moved the related codes inside for checking gold time purpose.
>   - Created addBall method to add new Ball in the ballEntry list
>   - Created BallEntry inner class for controlling each ball
>   - Moved properties of the ball like ballRadius, xBall, yBall, vX, vY, goDownBall and goRightBall is in BallEntry Class
>   - Deleted all the resetCollideFlags except collideToBlock, collideToBottomWall and collideBlock because those deleted variables have no need to be used outside the class
>   - Moved setPhysicsToBall in ballEntry class for controlling each different ball
>   - Modified setPhysicsToBall to interact with its movement, collisions with wall, block and break and collideBlock field is added to tell which block is hit
>   - Created isMinusHeart method in ballEntry class to check the life decrease
<br><br>
> - Block
>   - Maintained the original Block Class but, I changed the usage of it not for the single block 
>   - Deleted BlockSerializable Class because it is defined in BlockEntry class
>   - Moved fields and method related to Block from the Main to Block class like block array and initBoard
>   - Created BlockEntry inner class to define single Block
>   - Moved fields representing single block into BlockEntry Class like row, column, x, y, color, type and isDestroyed.
>   - Deleted fields like NO_HIT, HIT_RIGHT, HIT_BOTTOM, HIT_LEFT and HIT_TOP because it could be handled in Ball Class for the movement afterward
>   - Maintained BlockType fields like BLOCK_NORMAL, BLOCK_CHOCO, BLOCK_STAR, BLOCK_HEART and BLOCK_BALL
>   - Moved draw method in the BlockEntry class for drawing single block
>   - Deleted checkHitToBlock method since it can be handled in Ball class side - collideBlock field
>   - Deleted getter method because changed paddingTop, paddingWidth, height and width field to static for sharing anywhere
<br><br>
> - Break
>   - After creating Break Class and moved related code from the Main class to Break class
>   - Moved fields like breakX, breakY, centerBreakX and halfBreak and methods like move to Break class for single break
>   - Deleted fields like oldBreakX, LEFT and RIGHT since it is useless
<br><br>
> - Show
>   - Modified the naming of the class from Score to Show as the purpose of it was showing things like score and messages.
>   - Deleted showWin and showGameOver method because it would be displayed in the Menu Page.
>   - Modified the naming from show to showScore as it is showing score
>   - Create showCountDown method for counting 3 seconds before the game instances move
<br><br>
> - Bonus
>   - Maintained the original Bonus class, but its usage is not for single bonus
>   - Created BonusEntry inner class for single bonus
>   - Moved related codes from original Bonus class into BonusEntry class for representing each bonus
>   - Created BonusEntry list in the Bonus class to store multiple bonuses
>   - Created addBonus method to add new BonusEntry
<br><br>
> - LoadSave
>   - Deleted all the fields in the original LoadSave class
>   - Created Data(Serializable) inner class to store game variables with class units for the convenience of the saving and loading data
>   - Moved Load method from the Main class to LoadSave class
>   - Created isExistSavedFile method to check whether there is existing file
<br><br>
> - Main
>   - Moved all the game logics, view, engine and variables from Main class to Game Class
>   - Main class just make Game instance and start to optimize the Main class


### 6. Unexpected Problems
Communicate any unexpected challenges or issues you encountered during the assignment. Describe how you addressed or attempted to resolve them.
> - Changing Application UI : The UI of the game did not reflect the change correctly. 
This mostly occurred when promoting to the next level, ball hitting the block and changing the stages in the short time.
I thought the usage of the code "platform.runLater()" can handle this problem. I found out that
implementing UI operations, such as creating or modifying UI elements, should be performed on the JavaFX Application Thread. 
Tasks that take a significant amount of time should not be executed on the JavaFX Application Thread to prevent UI freezing.
That is, when a background thread needs to update the UI, use Platform.runLater() to schedule the UI update on the JavaFX Application Thread.
<br><br>
> - Dealing with threads : The main problem occurred when the game stops at unexpected moment. It was assumed that the update and physic thread in the GameEngine class was not working properly.
First, I moved the codes in physics method in Main class to update method. Then I deleted the physics method with physics thread in GameEngine class. It was mainly because multiple threads can lower the efficiency in this case. 
Also, it was intuitive to control the thread correctly and by adding stop/go method for the thread was better.
Therefore, the thread won't be terminated but will stop before the user wants to continue.
